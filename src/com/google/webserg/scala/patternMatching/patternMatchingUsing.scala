/**
  * Pattern Matching Versus Polymorphism
  * Pattern matching plays a central role in functional programming just as polymorphism
  * plays a central role in object-oriented programming. Functional pattern matching is
  * much more important and sophisticated than the corresponding switch/case statements
  * found in most imperative languages, like Java
