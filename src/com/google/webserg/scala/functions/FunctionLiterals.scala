  *         One of the main characteristics of a functional language is that functions
  *         are first class constructs, and thatï¿½s very true in Scala. For example, another
  *         (far more concise) way to print each command line argument is:
  *args.foreach(arg => println(arg))
  *         In this code, you call the foreach method on args, and pass in a function. In
  *         this case, youre passing in a function literal that takes one parameter named
  *arg. The body of the function is println(arg). If
