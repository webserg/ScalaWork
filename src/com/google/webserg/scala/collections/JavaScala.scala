/**
Since Scala arrays are implemented as Java arrays, you can pass them back and forth
between Java and Scala.
If you call a Java method that receives or returns a java.util.List, you could of course
use a Java ArrayList in your Scala code, but that is unattractive. Instead, import the
implicit conversion methods in scala.collection.JavaConversions. Then you can use
Scala buffers in your code, and they automatically get wrapped intoJava lists when
calling a Java method.
